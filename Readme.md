## Overview
Hey, Yash Here , The Work Which You See Above Is An Inspiration From 
[https://labs.jensimmons.com/2019/01-006D.html] Jen Simmons. The way she extended the limits of CSS Grids to create something asymmetric is amazing so I decided to give it a try myself. The Primary Objective Of This Project Is To Practice Working With Grids AndChallenge Myself To Create Something Distinct And Innovative.

### What I learned

By taking up this challenge I got a better understanding of CSS Grid.
One of the important thing I got to learn is that only use the properties when its actually needed rather than ending up with some bug in the code which is caused because you used something earlier in the code.
Also I realised that its okay to use hit and trial method to see what thing works the best for your site.

### Continued development

In future projects I will be more aware while defining the grid rows and columns. I will definetly make use of max-content and min-content propery while laying our rows and columns.
